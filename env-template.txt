# JUDGE TESTING RECOMMENDATIONS
# ==========================================

# For safe testing:
# 1. Use Base Sepolia testnet initially
# 2. Get testnet ETH from Base faucet
# 3. Start with PINATA keys only for basic functionality
# 4. Add premium RPC for better performance
# 5. Configure passive investment only for advanced testing

# For production testing:
# 1. Use very small amounts (0.00001 ETH or less)
# 2. Monitor all transactions on BaseScan
# 3. Test spend permission revocation
# 4. Verify token delivery to your wallet

# ==========================================
# SECURITY NOTES
# ==========================================

# - Never commit .env.local to version control
# - Private keys should only be for test wallets
# - Use separate wallets for testing vs production
# - Monitor spending limits and revoke after testing
# - All transactions are visible on blockchain

# ==========================================
# DEVELOPMENT SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
